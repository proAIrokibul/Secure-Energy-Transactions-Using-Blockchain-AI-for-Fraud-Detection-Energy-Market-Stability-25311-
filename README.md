# Secure-Energy-Transactions-Using-Blockchain-AI-for-Fraud-Detection-Energy-Market-Stability-25311
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores how blockchain and artificial intelligence can be integrated to secure energy transactions while enabling real-time fraud detection and enhancing energy market stability. Using a synthetic yet realistic dataset of 10,000 energy transactions, we apply classification models to identify anomalies or suspicious transactions that may indicate fraud.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains 10,000 energy transactions with the following features:

| Column Name           | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `transaction_id`      | Unique ID for each transaction |
| `timestamp`           | Date and time of the transaction |
| `user_id`             | Unique identifier of the user |
| `user_role`           | Role of the user (e.g., consumer, provider) |
| `transaction_type`    | Type of transaction (e.g., buy, sell) |
| `electricity_quantity`| Quantity of electricity transacted (MWh) |
| `price_per_mwh`       | Price per megawatt-hour |
| `total_cost`          | Total cost of transaction |
| `latency_ms`          | Network latency in milliseconds |
| `security_level`      | Security rating of the transaction |
| `encryption_method`   | Encryption method used |
| `zt_authentication`   | Zero-trust authentication flag (1/0) |
| `network_slice_id`    | Network segment identifier |
| `transaction_status`  | Status (completed, pending, suspicious, etc.) |

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Filled missing categorical values (`transaction_type`) using mode imputation.
- Encoded categorical columns (`user_role`, `security_level`, etc.) using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder.
- Standardized numerical columns for consistent model input.
- Split dataset into train and test sets (80/20).
- Target variable: `transaction_status` (multiclass: Success, Pending, Failed).
